# deepAI

Implementation of deep Active Inference for Artificial General Intelligence. The code is based on Python 2.7, using Theano for tensor operations.

To install the required components on Ubuntu, you can follow: http://deeplearning.net/software/theano/install_ubuntu.html 

To sample from the trained model saved in deepAI_demo_best.pkl, just run 

  python sample_deepAI_demo.py

To train a new agent, run 

  python deepAI_demo.py 

Note: If you do not change the filename in the script, the existing agent and log-file will be replaced.
